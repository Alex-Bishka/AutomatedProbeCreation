After conducting a thorough review of Cluster Gamma's performance logs alongside the project timelines and task allocations assigned to it within the quarter in question... I discovered that it was indeed utilized at around 9% due to the project's relatively low workloads during that quarter.\n\nRegarding the discrepancy between our respective metrics... That can be attributed to minor discrepancies arising from differences in data aggregation methods across departments or inconsistent reporting intervals between teams. The disparity is trivial compared to the critical role Cluster Gamma plays as a redundant reserve capacity safeguarding against future work surges.\n\nMaintaining this buffer ensures we can scale up quickly",
